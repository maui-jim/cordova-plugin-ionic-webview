### 2.0.0 (PENDING)

* **BREAKING**: HTTP server now runs for iOS **and** Android, instead of just iOS. The server is configured the same for both platforms.
* **BREAKING**: HTTP server now loads the app from a base href of `/`. The app URL behaves like `http://localhost:8080/index.html` instead of `http://localhost:8080/Users/.../index.html`.
* **BREAKING**: HTTP server is configured to run in HTML5 routing mode (push state) by default.
* **BREAKING**: File access through the Web View must be served by the HTTP server to avoid security errors in the Web View. Loading files via `file://` is not allowed by the Web View. The HTTP server will serve files via the `_file_` prefix, e.g. `http://localhost:8080/_file_/Users/.../file.png`.
* `window.Ionic.normalizeURL()` has been deprecated. Use `window.Ionic.WebView.convertFileSrc()`.

See [Github releases](https://github.com/ionic-team/cordova-plugin-ionic-webview/releases) for earlier changes.
